      And what was the result? The sausage trudged off toward the forest; the
      bird made the fire; and the mouse put on the pot and waited for the
      sausage to return with wood for the next day. However, the sausage stayed
      out so long that the other two feared that something bad had happened. The
      bird flew off to see if he could find her. A short distance away he came
      upon a dog that had seized the sausage as free booty and was making off
      with her. The bird complained bitterly to the dog about this brazen
      abduction, but he claimed that he had discovered forged letters on the
      sausage, and that she would thus have to forfeit her life to him.
