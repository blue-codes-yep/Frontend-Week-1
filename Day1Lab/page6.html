      When the bird wanted to eat, no cook was there. Beside himself, he threw
      the wood this way and that, called out, looked everywhere, but no cook was
      to be found. Because of his carelessness, the scattered wood caught fire,
      and the entire house was soon aflame. The bird rushed to fetch water, but
      the bucket fell into the well, carrying him with it, and he drowned.
