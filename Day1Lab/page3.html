    <p>
      The next day, because of his friend's advice, the bird refused to go to
      the forest, saying that he had been their servant long enough. He was no
      longer going to be a fool for them. Everyone should try a different task
      for a change. The mouse and the sausage argued against this, but the bird
      was the master, and he insisted that they give it a try. The sausage was
      to fetch wood, the mouse became the cook, and the bird was to carry water.
