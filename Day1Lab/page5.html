    <p>
      Filled with sorrow, the bird carried the wood home himself and told the
      mouse what he had seen and heard. They were very sad, but were determined
      to stay together and make the best of it. The bird set the table while the
      mouse prepared the food. She jumped into the pot, as the sausage had
      always done, in order to slither and weave in and about the vegetables and
      grease them, but before she reached the middle, her hair and skin were
      scalded off, and she perished.
