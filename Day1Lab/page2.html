    <p>
      Whoever is too well off always wants to try something different! Thus one
      day the bird chanced to meet another bird, who boasted to him of his own
      situation. This bird criticized him for working so hard while the other
      two enjoyed themselves at home. For after the mouse had made the fire and
      carried the water, she could sit in the parlor and rest until it was time
      for her to set the table. The sausage had only to stay by the pot watching
      the food cook. When mealtime approached, she would slither through the
      porridge or the vegetables, and thus everything was greased and salted and
      ready to eat. The bird would bring his load of wood home. They would eat
      their meal, and then sleep soundly until the next morning. It was a great
      life.
